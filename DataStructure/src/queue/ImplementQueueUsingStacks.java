	// Approach
	/*
	 * This Question was asked in Google. But this is very easy. You just maintain
	 * two stack one for push and second for pop.
	 * 
	 * Step 1 : We all know that if we push element in stack then last element would
	 * be in top or stack work on LIFO principle whereas queue work on FIFO means
	 * the first element which was added should be remove first.
	 * 
	 * Step 2 : Use first stack to push elements and second for as a helper.
	 * 
	 * Step 3 : Insertion is very easy in stack just push the element. Since stack
	 * is using array internally and you know how array stores elements.
	 * 
	 * Step 4 : The challenge is how to remove? because if you do pop from stack
	 * then it will remove last inserted element not the first one which queue does.
	 * 
	 * Step 5 : Solution is : pop() element from first stack and push in second
	 * stack. Now do the same thing pop() element from second stack and push in
	 * first stack and return popped element. Here we good to goðŸ˜Š.
	 * 
	 * Step 6 : Now for peek element. Do the same this like as step 5 and instead of
	 * returning pop return peek elementðŸ˜Š.
