	 * Here, we will create custom circular Queue and then will perform some
	 * operations. In this we can add elements from front as well as end. Same for
	 * deletions also.
	 * 
	 * Step 1 : Since this is also using array internally, Hence creating array
	 * variables.
	 * 
	 * Step 2 : Here, we need to pointer front and end to do insertions or deletions
	 * from both end.
	 * 
	 * Step 3 : TO insert() elements first need to check whether it is full or not.
	 * If not full then add elements and while adding keep in mind that how to
	 * calculate index. for that end % data.length.
	 * 
	 * Step 4 : To remove() elements we don't need to shift element because it is a
	 * circular queue. But to find the correct index and add elements later we have
	 * to find index. for that front % data.length.
	 * 
	 * Step 4 : Front() method give the first value which is in queue.
	 * 
	 * Step 5 : Now Display the elements of Queue. While displaying you should know
	 * that initially front and end pointing to zero.Hence if you will try then it
	 * will print nothing. For the same made changes in Display() method as below.
